# Contributing to BOWL

Thank you for taking the time to contribute to this community project.

By its nature, BOWL will require the innovation and knowledge developed by the community.

## How does BOWL work?

There are two major halves to any compiler:
- The front end, handles converting human readable code into a intermediate code for the back end
- The back end, takes the intermediate code and produces the compiled files

## Where is help needed?

Progress towards a functional build is tracked in [the V0.1 project](https://github.com/ferrisfox/BOWL/projects/1)

The current development focus is on the front end. 
see the ["Functional front end" issue](https://github.com/ferrisfox/BOWL/issues/4) for current progress.
