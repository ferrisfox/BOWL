# Block Oriented Wicked Language

An object-oriented programming language for creating Minecraft function files. 
Written in Ruby.

## About BOWL

BOWL is a compiled language with strong and strict typing.

The syntax resembles Java, C and other languages with a similar heritage,
and uses similar formating to Minecraft commands for implementing their unique functionality.
(i.e. an array of all creative players can be accessed through the variable @a[mode=creative])

## Development

Early development is currently ongoing.

No functioning compiler is currently available.
